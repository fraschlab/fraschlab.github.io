# The Perinatal Whole Health Crisis

Neglecting maternal health -- physical, mental, and social -- programs a lifetime of risk for both parent and child, with staggering economic consequences.

## A Common, Costly, and Preventable Crisis

- **1 in 3** birthing people experience a significant mental or physical health complication during the perinatal period
- **$46.5+ billion**: the underestimated annual cost in the U.S. from just two sets of conditions
- **80%** of pregnancy-related deaths in the U.S. are estimated to be preventable

These are not rare events. They are systemic failures with enormous human and economic costs, and the vast majority of them are avoidable with the right investments.

## How a Mother's Health Programs a Child's Life

The nine months of pregnancy and the first few years of life are a critical window where a mother's well-being creates a biological blueprint for her child's future health.

**Mental and Social Health**
Stress, depression, and trauma can alter fetal brain development and create a toxic stress environment after birth. Maternal mental health conditions change the hormonal and inflammatory environment of the womb, with lasting effects on the child's neurodevelopment, stress response, and emotional regulation.

**Cardiovascular Health**
Hypertension and preeclampsia can restrict fetal growth and program a lifelong risk for heart disease in the child. These conditions compromise placental blood flow, limiting the nutrients and oxygen available during the most critical period of organ development.

**Metabolic Health**
Gestational diabetes exposes the fetus to high blood sugar, increasing their future risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The metabolic environment of the womb calibrates the child's own metabolic systems, setting trajectories that persist into adulthood.

## The Burden on the Next Generation

The economic fallout from perinatal neglect disproportionately harms the child. Investing in parents is the most direct way to invest in the health and productivity of the future workforce.

Of the $32.3 billion cost of maternal morbidity, the largest share falls on the children who carry the biological consequences of preventable complications into their own lives. These costs manifest as increased healthcare utilization, developmental delays, educational challenges, and reduced lifetime earning potential.

## A Crisis of Inequity

Systemic racism drives higher rates of chronic stress and dangerous complications like preeclampsia, leading to preventable deaths of Black and Indigenous mothers and infants at alarming rates.

- The maternal mortality rate is **2.6x higher** for Black women compared to white women
- Indigenous communities face similarly disproportionate burdens
- These disparities persist even after controlling for income, education, and access to care, pointing to the biological toll of structural inequality itself

Addressing perinatal health inequity is not only a moral imperative but an economic one. The communities bearing the greatest burden represent an enormous pool of unrealized human potential.

## Investment in Parents is Prevention

Investing in comprehensive, integrated care for parents before, during, and after pregnancy is a high-return economic strategy that builds a healthier and more prosperous future.

- **Annual ROI**: 13% for high-quality early childhood programs
- **Return to society**: $6 -- $17 for every $1 invested in early childhood

The evidence is clear: prevention is not just cheaper than treatment, it is vastly more effective. Every dollar spent on upstream investment in parental health averts many more dollars in downstream costs for both parent and child.
