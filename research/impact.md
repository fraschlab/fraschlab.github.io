The Frasch Lab's research spans multiple domains of perinatal neuroscience and biosensor development, with impact across clinical medicine, computational biology, and public health.

Our work has contributed to:

- Advancing non-invasive fetal monitoring technologies
- Developing machine learning approaches for biosignal analysis
- Understanding prenatal stress effects on neurodevelopment
- Elucidating neuroinflammatory pathways in the developing brain
- Building open-source computational tools for the research community
- Training the next generation of perinatal researchers
