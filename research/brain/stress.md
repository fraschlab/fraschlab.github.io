title: "Prenatal Stress"
---

The Frasch Lab investigates chronic stress during pregnancy and its effects on fetal and neonatal neurodevelopment. Our research emphasizes early detection and intervention strategies to mitigate long-term developmental consequences.

## Overview

Early identification of fetuses exposed to prenatal stress enables therapeutic intervention before significant damage occurs. The effects of prenatal stress range from increased autism spectrum disorder risk to Parkinson's and Alzheimer's susceptibility. The metabolic costs of chronic stress represent an underexplored research avenue.

A key finding: **stressed fetuses entrain their heartbeat to the maternal heartbeat, but non-stressed fetuses do not.** This multinational research team examines stress system impacts across genomic, molecular, biophysical, and behavioral levels.

## Research Focus Areas

- **Psychosocial stress mechanisms:** Associations between pregnancy stress and preterm birth outcomes
- **Biomarker development:** Non-invasive detection methods reflecting fetal brain epigenetic changes
- **Neuroimmunometabolic hypothesis:** Framework connecting developmental origins to autism spectrum disorder
- **Microglial responses:** How early stress creates lasting changes affecting adult neurodegeneration risk
- **Maternal-fetal signaling:** The fetus as a "radar" detecting maternal physiological stress states
- **Intervention strategies:** Early identification programs for at-risk infants

## Methods

- Heart rate variability analysis
- Electrocardiogram monitoring
- Placental vascular assessment
- Multi-scale, multi-species comparative approaches
- Machine learning for stress detection from biosignals
