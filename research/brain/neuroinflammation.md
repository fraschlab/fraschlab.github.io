The Frasch Lab investigates mechanisms of fetal brain inflammation, with particular focus on the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and its role in fetal development and neuroprotection.

## Cholinergic Anti-Inflammatory Pathway

The connection between brain and innate immune system occurs via the vagus nerve. Our research demonstrates that fetal cholinergic activity in pre-term sheep can suppress both systemic and brain inflammation near term, offering potential diagnostic and treatment applications for neuroinflammatory disorders across fetal, neonatal, and adult populations.

### Selected Publications

- **Durosier et al. (2013)** &mdash; Documented "neural signature of cerebral activity" of the fetal cholinergic pathway using heart rate variability analysis
- **Garzoni et al. (2013)** &mdash; Explored the "brain-gut connection" in utero regarding necrotizing enterocolitis
- **Frasch et al. (2016)** &mdash; Found "decreased neuroinflammation correlates to higher vagus nerve activity fluctuations" in near-term fetal sheep

## Microglial Inflammation Models

We developed a unique in vivo/in vitro model of double-hit exposure of fetal microglia to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This demonstrates how inflammatory phenotypes persist during culture transition and amplify upon re-exposure, revealing critical mechanisms in perinatal inflammation affecting brain development.

### Key Findings

- Fetal microglial cells retain inflammatory "memory of prior in vivo exposure"
- RNAseq analysis identified links between iron homeostasis and cholinergic modulation
- Alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors modulate inflammatory responses and iron regulation

## Laboratory Techniques

- Chronic fetal instrumentation and monitoring
- Primary microglia and astrocyte cultures
- RNAseq transcriptional profiling
- Nicotinic receptor signaling manipulation
