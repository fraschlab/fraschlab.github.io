Early and reliable detection of fetal brain injury remains an unsolved challenge in fetal health monitoring. The Frasch Lab develops heart rate variability (HRV) based approaches to address this challenge.

## Overview

Using fetal sheep models, we demonstrated that fetal HRV functions as a non-invasive detection tool, outperforming standard FHR monitoring for identifying asphyxia near-term. We identified why conventional monitors struggle with detecting fetal acidemia and advanced toward identifying individual cardiovascular decompensation events&mdash;critical indicators of incipient brain damage.
