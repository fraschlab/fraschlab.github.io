title: "EEG Monitoring"
---

The Frasch Lab focuses on fetal EEG monitoring during labor to predict severe acidemia and prevent brain injury. Our research demonstrates that changes in fetal electrocortical activity can predict severe acidemia during labour with sufficient advance notice for clinical intervention.

## Fetal Brain Monitoring

We developed an automated algorithm for unsupervised monitoring and detection of EEG-FHR pattern pathognomonic of adaptive brain shut-down as an early response to oxygen deprivation. This technology is undergoing clinical translation and validation.

## Thalamocortical Communication

Using juvenile pig models, we demonstrated that cortico-cortical EEG signals can measure thalamic gating under varying sedation levels, providing insights into brain communication pathways.

## Clinical Translation

We are actively translating these findings to clinical bedside use, with ongoing clinical trials registered for intrapartum fetal EEG monitoring.
