The Frasch Lab develops non-invasive fetal ECG monitoring approaches to identify fetuses developing acidemia using heart rate variability (HRV) analysis with FDA-approved transabdominal fetal ECG monitors.

## Research Focus

### Fetal Monitoring Applications
- Non-invasive identification of fetuses developing acidemia using multidimensional fetal HRV analyses
- Detection of systemic and gut fetal inflammatory response in fetal sheep models
- Identification of chronic stress exposure during pregnancy, Zika virus exposure, and autism spectrum disorder

### Theoretical Contributions
We investigate the origins of fetal HRV in the stochastic fluctuations of cardiac sinus node cells' ion channels as a foundation for understanding the memory of chronic hypoxia in HRV patterns.

## The HRV Code

We conceptualize an "HRV code" framework synthesizing findings across species and conditions to develop generalized understanding of heart rate variability beyond fetal applications.
