# minAction.net: A Search for Vertically Organizing Principles

The manuscript proposes a paradigm shift in physiology: move from studying causality **within** specific scales (e.g., molecular, cellular) to finding **vertically organizing principles** that are invariant **across** all scales.

## Network-Weighted Action

This is the central candidate for such a principle. Inspired by the Principle of Least Action in physics, it suggests that biological systems at every level -- from genes to organisms -- evolve and operate to minimize a "network-weighted action."

This "action" is a function that balances competing needs:

- **Energy Expenditure:** Minimizing metabolic and resource costs
- **Information Processing:** Maximizing the ability to sense, predict, and adapt
- **Network Connectivity:** Minimizing connection costs (e.g., wiring length) while maintaining robust information flow

The core idea is that principles governing optimal information flow and energy distribution through networks are the "scale-invariant laws" we are seeking.
