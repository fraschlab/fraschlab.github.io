Our brain health research examines the broader outcomes of perinatal events on lifelong brain function and the developmental origins of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Focus Areas

- Connections between prenatal exposures and long-term neurological outcomes
- Developmental origins of neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis)
- The role of glial biology, microglia, and astrocytes in brain health across the lifespan
- Biomarker development for early identification of at-risk individuals
