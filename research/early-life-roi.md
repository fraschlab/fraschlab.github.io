# The Longevity Dividend: The Highest ROI in Healthcare

Investing in early-life and pediatric health isn't just a social good; it's the most powerful economic strategy for a prosperous and sustainable future. The returns are measured not just in dollars, but in decades of human potential.

The health of mothers, fathers, and infants sets the stage for a lifetime of well-being. Neglecting this critical window has profound, multi-generational impacts on families and economies. We believe that investing in early-life health brings the highest ROI in healthcare, which is why the Frasch Lab is dedicated to pioneering solutions through prevention and early detection.

## By the Numbers

- **$13** returned for every **$1** invested in comprehensive early childhood development programs
- **$10.9** societal return for every **$1** spent on routine childhood immunizations
- **$2.7 trillion** in net societal savings from immunizing U.S. children born between 1994 and 2023

## The Why: The Economic Imperative of Early Intervention

The work of Nobel laureate James Heckman proves that the highest rate of return comes from investing as early as possible. Skills beget skills, and health begets health, in a process of "dynamic complementarity." The earlier we intervene, the greater and more compounding the returns become over a lifetime.

Early investments create a cascade of positive outcomes: healthier children become more capable learners, who become more productive adults, who raise healthier families of their own. The multiplier effect of early-life investment far exceeds any intervention made later in life.

## The What: Where Investment Matters Most

Effective early-life investment spans multiple domains:

- **Prenatal care and maternal health** -- ensuring a healthy developmental environment from the start
- **Early detection and monitoring** -- identifying risks before they become irreversible
- **Nutritional support and immunization** -- building the biological foundation for lifelong health
- **Parental mental health** -- addressing the psychosocial environment that shapes early brain development

## The Impact: A Generational Return

When we invest in the perinatal period, the benefits ripple across generations. Children born to supported, healthy parents experience fewer chronic diseases, achieve higher educational attainment, and contribute more productively to the economy. The costs of *not* investing -- in emergency care, special education, lost productivity, and chronic disease management -- dwarf the upfront investment in prevention.

## The How: From Evidence to Action

Translating the economic case into real-world change requires:

1. **Research** -- Building the evidence base for early-life interventions through rigorous science
2. **Technology** -- Developing accessible tools for early detection and monitoring
3. **Policy** -- Advocating for systemic investment in maternal and infant health
4. **Equity** -- Ensuring that the benefits of early-life investment reach every community

The Frasch Lab contributes to this mission through our work on [brain health](/research/brain-health/), fetal monitoring, and the development of biomarkers that can identify risk early enough to act.
