[ResearchTwin](https://researchtwin.net) transforms your publications, code, and datasets into a live knowledge graph with the **S-Index** — an open metric for research quality, impact, and collaboration.

## Features

- **Interactive Knowledge Graph:** Visualize connections between papers, code repositories, datasets, and citations as a force-directed network
- **S-Index Scoring:** An experimental open metric for research evaluation, complementing traditional metrics like the h-index
- **Data Integration:** Aggregates from Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar, GitHub, and Figshare
- **Paper Impact Tracking:** Citation aggregation and impact calculation
- **Repository & Dataset Counting:** Track your open-source contributions
