The Frasch Lab has developed a computational model simulating labor physiology, focusing on understanding fetal cardiovascular and metabolic responses during labor contractions.

## Key Publication

**Wang Q, Gold N, Frasch MG, Huang H, Thiriet M, Wang S.** "Mathematical modeling of cardiovascular and metabolic responses to umbilical cord occlusions in fetal sheep." *Bulletin of Mathematical Biology* 77.12 (2015): 2264-93.

## About the Model

In partnership with applied mathematicians from York University, we constructed a computational simulation of the birthing process. This model provides insights into how fetal physiology responds to reduced oxygen availability during uterine contractions.

## Applications

1. **Hypothesis Testing:** Functions as an accessible computational platform for validating physiological theories relevant to fetal monitoring technology development

2. **Model Refinement:** New experimental measurements can enhance the model's accuracy, while the model can estimate physiological parameters that resist direct measurement

## Call for Collaboration

We invite data science, computer science, and engineering professionals to help convert the current MATLAB implementation into a web-based application accessible to the broader research community. [Get in touch.](/about/ask/)
