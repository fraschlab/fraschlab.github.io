# In Silico Modeling of the Labour Process

The Frasch Lab, in collaboration with applied mathematicians from York University, developed a computational model of the labour process. This simulation provides understanding of cardiovascular and metabolic responses of the fetus during the trial of labour.

## About the Model

This digital model functions as a low-cost testing ground for validation of physiological hypotheses relevant to devising more efficient fetal health monitoring technologies. Newly gathered physiological data can refine the model and help researchers determine variables that cannot be directly measured.

The simulation captures the complex interplay between uterine contractions, umbilical cord compression, and fetal physiological responses, allowing researchers to explore scenarios that would be impossible or unethical to study directly.
