## Our Mission

The health of mothers, fathers, and infants sets the stage for a lifetime of well-being. Neglecting this critical window has profound, multi-generational impacts on families and economies. We believe that investing in [early-life health](/research/early-life-roi/) brings the [highest ROI in healthcare](/research/impact/), which is why the Frasch Lab is dedicated to pioneering solutions through prevention and early detection.

## About the Lab

The Frasch Lab studies the brain's responses to asphyxia, inflammation/infection, and stress during the perinatal period. We apply machine learning and AI frameworks to convert medical data into physiological phenotypes with individualized predictive potential.

Our work emphasizes non-invasive monitoring technologies (ECG, EEG) to identify at-risk babies, and preclinical research examining how prenatal harmful events shape [brain development](/research/brain-health/)&mdash;particularly regarding glial biology, microglia, and astrocytes relevant to neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.
