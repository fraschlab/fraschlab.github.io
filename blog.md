<h3>Chronic Stress & Fetal Iron</h3>
<p>Research indicates that <a href="https://rdcu.be/cRFh5">chronic stress in the third trimester reduces baby's iron</a> as measured at birth, with findings published in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. This work received coverage on <a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/chronic-stress-in-pregnancy-reduces-babies-iron">KUOW (Seattle NPR)</a>, discussing pregnancy health and stress impacts on fetal development.</p>
